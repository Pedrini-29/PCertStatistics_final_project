Part 1 – injury case 
With this report we would like to assess the problematic of an unusual high rate of fatalities per burn 
injuries. Inefficient hospital care is considered a possible responsible for the problem. The investigation 
is necessary to identify risk factors in order to correctly allocate patients to emergency care when 
needed in order to avoid fatalities. 

Part 2 - Part 2 – School case 
This report is to answer the inquiry of the Prime Minister to review the allocation of the budget for the 
schools in Ireland, in particular we investigated how current budget allocation has been influenced 
student performance and suggested improvements to boost student achievements.
